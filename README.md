For CODTECH Internship Task-2, we developed a modular C program to implement a singly linked list that supports dynamic insertion, deletion, and traversal of elements. The program uses a struct to define each node and pointer logic to manipulate the list. We executed and tested the program using the Programiz Online C Compiler, which provided an easy and accessible way to build and debug our code without requiring local setup. This task helped us understand the fundamentals of dynamic memory allocation and pointer-based data structures in C. Linked lists are critical in software development for efficient memory use and flexibility, and they are widely used in applications such as operating systems, memory management, and real-time data processing. Mastering linked lists lays the foundation for learning more advanced structures like stacks, queues, and graphs.
